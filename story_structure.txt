1) Beginning
    Should quickly show us who the protagonist is, what their nightly routine or comfort is, and a hint of what they might wonder about or wish for.

    Should pose a small, gentle question or spark curiosity (e.g., “What is that light?” or “Who is visiting?”), but not create strong fear or tension.

    Should feel calm and familiar, as if we are peeking into a cozy moment that was already happening.

    Should lightly suggest the magical or imaginative tone of the story.

    Should hook the child’s curiosity in a soothing way, inviting them to dream along with the character.

2) Middle
    Allows the child to see the protagonist explore something magical or gentle (a friendly fairy, a soft adventure, a dream journey).

    Keeps the tone reassuring and calm, avoiding scary or overly suspenseful moments.

    Might include simple repetition or gentle rhythms to lull the listener.

    Should let the protagonist have agency — they choose to explore or go along on the adventure.

    Keeps everything dreamlike and wonder-filled.

3) Climax
    A mild peak moment of wonder (e.g., visiting new planets, meeting kind magical creatures), but no harsh conflict.

    Often a moment of awe, discovery, or a heartfelt connection.

    Protagonist learns something joyful or collects a happy memory.

    Should be emotionally satisfying, not frightening.

    The child feels safe knowing it is time to return home.

4) Ending
    Quickly follows the gentle climax with a safe return to the cozy bedtime setting.

    Protagonist is reassured, snuggled back in their bed, and at peace.

    Their small wish or curiosity from the beginning is fulfilled with a comforting answer or magical memory.

    Leaves the sense that the protagonist will dream of more adventures, giving the story an “ever after” feeling.

    Should close softly, with a gentle sense of wonder, letting the child fall asleep peacefully.
